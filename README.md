# AutoChar
Use this to generate a random DnD character sheet!

Running the python script will overwrite the character sheet currently in Random_Character.pdf
You must have a pdf called Random_Character.pdf for this to work, so duplicate the sheet if you wish to save its current state.

CHANGE PLAN:
 - Finish streamlining code
    - Move classes and subclasses to excel spreadsheet
 - Add missing classes/subclasses
 - Automatically choose feats
 - Assign a character traits, then choose feats/classes/etc based off of these traits
 - END GOAL: Use gpt3/text-generation AI to produce backstories for characters
